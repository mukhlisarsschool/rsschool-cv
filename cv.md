   int sum = 0;
   Double average;
   
   // access all elements using for each loop
   // add each element in sum
   for (int number: numbers) {
     sum += number;
   }
  
   // get the total number of elements
   int arrayLength = numbers.length;

   // calculate the average
   // convert the average from int to double
   average =  ((double)sum / (double)arrayLength);

   System.out.println("Sum = " + sum);
